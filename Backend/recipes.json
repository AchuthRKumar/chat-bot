Puree until very smooth.\nToss the marinade through the pork in a large bowl until very well coated. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours up to overnight.\nStand your rotisserie skewer upright and secure it in a vase, wine cooler or umbrella stand with rocks or sand - this is to keep it upright for loading. Thread a small cardboard container onto the skewer to the bottom to catch the drippings.\nHalve the pineapple crossways to make 2 rounds, then thread 1 half onto the skewer and secure in place with the spikes.\nStart skewering the pork slices, aiming for an even layer all the way around, with the pork being just wider than the pineapple. Continue until all the pork is skewered and you have an even log shape. Make sure you're mixing up the leaner pieces of pork with the fattier pieces.\nThread the other piece of pineapple on top and secure in place with the other spike/prong.\nPreheat a charcoal grill with rotisserie to 200°C (390°F). Pile the coal up on 2 sides of the grill, allowing a gap directly underneath to avoid any flare up during cooking.\nPlace the skewer in place and begin rotating the meat.\nOnce the outer layer of pork starts to char (about 45 minutes in), you can begin carving. Keep the rotisserie turning and hold a small frying pan directly under the meat to catch the slices. Use a sharp knife to shave off thin pieces of pork and pineapple from the outside. Work carefully and stay clear of any hot coals.\nContinue to thinly slice off the cooked outer pieces of the pork along with some pineapple as it continues to rotate.\nServe pork in toasted corn tortillas with diced white onion, coriander and salsa verde or salsa roja to drizzle.",

    "instructions": "In a large bowl, combine the rice, urad dal, chana dal, and fenugreek seeds. Rinse under cold water twice, then cover with water and let soak at room temperature for 4 hours.\nDrain and place the soaked rice and lentils into a blender, adding half of the soaking water. Blend until mostly smooth, aiming for a slightly gritty, fine texture. I recommend blending in two batches to ensure it’s blended well. Transfer to a bowl, mix gently, then cover with a lid and a tea towel. Leave in a warm spot to ferment for 10 hours.\nHeat the oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and urad dal, toasting for 1–2 minutes until aromatic. Add the diced onion, ginger, garlic, green chillies, curry leaves, and a pinch of salt. Stir well and cook until the onions soften slightly.\nStir in the tomatoes, tamarind paste, and about 200ml (¾ cup) of water. Cover and cook for 35–40 minutes, until the tomatoes, onions, and garlic break down fully. Now you can start your coconut chutney while you wait for it to cook.\nAfter you’ve made your coconut chutney, go back to your tomato chutney (if you left it too long and it’s dry, just stir in a little bit of water). Allow to cool slightly, then blend until smooth. Adjust seasoning if needed, and keep at room temperature until serving.\nTo grate or shred fresh coconut, crack open the coconut, remove the outer hard shell and peel the white flesh from the brown husk, then cut into small pieces and blitz in a blender until shredded. Note - I use a pallet knife to remove the outer shell just in case it slips as it’s not sharp.\nToast your chana dal and ajwain in a dry pan over medium heat.\nCombine coconut, chana, ajwain, shallots, ginger, chillies, coconut water, half the curry leaves, lemon juice and a pinch of salt in a blender.\nProcess until well blended, scraping down sides occasionally.\nHeat oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Temper the mustard seeds, red chilli and remaining curry leaves in the oil for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.\nTransfer chutney to a serving bowl and pour over the tempered oil, then gently stir in, then serve.\nPut you potatoes on to boil. I recommend starting this step as early as possible so they’re cooked and cooled before you start the rest of this recipe.\nPrep your ingredients. Then, in a pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil and add the diced onion, cumin seeds, garlic, curry leaves, sliced green chillies and a big pinch of salt. Saute for 4-5 minutes until the onions go translucent.\nAdd the cooked baby potatoes (you can mash them lightly before or in the pan), turmeric, and salt. Mix well and set aside to cool to room temperature.\nHeat a heavy based frying pan over medium low heat. Dry fry the channa dhal and toor dhal for 5 minutes, stirring, until starting to colour. Add urad, cook a further few minutes until well toasted.\nAdd sesame seeds and cook until starting to brown, then stir in the cumin seeds and cook for a further minute until fragrant. Set aside in a bowl to cool.\nHeat oil in the same pan over medium. Cook chillies, garlic and curry leaves, until chillies start to colour and leaves crispen. Add some salt. Set aside to cool.\nTransfer everything to a spice grinder and grind to a powder.\nMelt the clarified butter (ghee).\nOnce the dosa batter has fermented, stir in the salt and mix again. If the batter feels too thick, add a little water until it reaches the consistency of pouring cream.\nPreheat a large cast-iron pan over high heat for 5–6 minutes. Splash a little water on the pan; it should sizzle immediately. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the pan and spread it in a circular motion to create a thin, even layer. I just use the ladle and go in circular motions to spread it out.\nAfter 1–2 minutes, when the dosa begins to brown on the bottom, drizzle a small amount of ghee around the edges. Sprinkle the gunpowder around, place a portion of the aloo masala in the centre, then fold three edges over to form a triangle.\nCarefully flip it over onto a plate and serve hot with the tomato chutney and coconut chutney.

Peel and finely dice the garlic. Chop the rosemary and thyme. Set everything aside.\nHeat a large cast-iron or heavy-based frying pan over medium-high heat and add the beef tallow. Once the tallow is hot, sear the diced beef cheeks in batches until golden brown on all sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.\nIn the same pan, add the diced onions and carrots with a pinch of salt. Sauté for 1–2 minutes.\nAdd the celery, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and bay leaves. Continue to sauté for another 2–3 minutes.\nStir in the tomato purée, then deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping up any browned bits. Ensure the purée is well combined with the vegetables.\nAdd the seared beef back to the pan, then pour in the beef stock and bring to a gentle simmer.\nTransfer the mixture to a Dutch oven or deep baking tray. If using a Dutch oven, cover with a lid. If using a tray, cover with parchment paper and two layers of foil. Cook in a preheated oven at 160°C (320°F) for 3 hours, until the meat is tender but still holding together.\nWhile the meat is cooking, add the flour and cold diced butter to a food processor. Pulse until the butter is evenly distributed, forming a sandy consistency. Add a pinch of salt.\nWith the machine running, gradually add ice-cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together into a loose ball.\nDivide the pastry into two discs (one for the base, one for the top). Wrap tightly in cling film and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.\nOnce the beef is cooked, remove from the oven and strain the cooking liquid into a saucepan.\nBring the liquid to a light simmer and check for seasoning.\nDissolve the cornflour in a little water, then whisk it into the simmering liquid until thickened. Start with half and add more if needed.\nStir the beef back into the thickened sauce, then transfer to a tray and let cool completely—ideally overnight.\nThe next day, remove the pastry from the fridge 20 minutes before rolling.\nRoll out the bottom pastry on parchment paper to 4mm (⅙ inch) thick, slightly larger than your pie tin by about 5cm (2 inches).\nGrease the pie tin with clarified butter or any available fat, then carefully press the pastry into the tin, ensuring it reaches all corners.\nTrim the excess pastry, leaving a 2cm (¾ inch) overhang. Roll out the top pastry to the same thickness, large enough to cover the pie.\nPlace the pie tin and top pastry back in the fridge to chill while you grate the cheese.\nAfter 20 minutes, remove the pie tin from the fridge and generously fill it with the beef mixture, slightly doming the filling.\nSprinkle the grated smoked cheddar evenly over the filling.\nLay the top pastry over the pie, trim any excess, and crimp the edges to seal.\nBeat the egg well and brush the top of the pie with egg wash.\nCut a small steam vent in the top and preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan) / 400°F (350°F fan).\nChill the assembled pie in the fridge for 20 minutes, then bake for 35–40 minutes, or until golden brown.\nRemove from the oven and let the pie rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.",

Avoid overworking to keep the gnocchi light.\nDust your work surface with flour, divide the dough, and roll into logs about two fingers thick.\nCut each log into pieces roughly 2.5cm (1 inch) long.\nPlace the gnocchi on a floured tray until ready to cook.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches, add the gnocchi, stirring gently to prevent sticking.\nOnce the gnocchi floats to the top, cook for another 30 seconds, then remove with a slotted spoon and place on an oiled tray to cool in the fridge.\nGnocchi can be made 1–2 days ahead and stored covered in the fridge.\nSeason the skin side of the duck legs with salt.\nAdd 2 tbsp olive oil to a cold pan with a lid (a Dutch oven works well).\nPlace the duck legs skin side down and cook over medium heat until golden and the fat has rendered.\nSeason the other side with salt, flip, and cook briefly for colour. Remove and set aside.\nIn the same pan, add the onion with a pinch of salt. Sauté for 1–2 minutes until lightly golden.\nAdd the carrot, celery, and garlic. Stir well, then add the tomato purée and cook for 1 minute.\nDeglaze the pan with white wine, scraping up any browned bits.\nAdd the bay leaf and rosemary. Return the duck legs to the pan, skin side up.\nPour in the chicken stock until it nearly covers the duck.\nBring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook on low heat for 1½ to 2 hours until the duck is tender.\nRemove the duck legs from the liquid. Reduce the sauce slightly over medium heat.\nShred the duck meat, chopping the skin finely. Add both back into the sauce.\nFold the meat through the sauce, then transfer to a tray to cool. Refrigerate until needed.\nHeat portions of the duck ragu in a pan until hot.\nIn another pan, heat olive oil over high heat. Pan-fry the gnocchi until golden on all sides.\nAdd a small knob of butter to finish the gnocchi, tossing to coat.\nTo plate, spoon the duck ragout onto the plate, top with the crispy gnocchi, and finish with shaved Pecorino and a drizzle of olive oil.

Prepare your baking tray by lining it with baking paper and drizzling about 2 tablespoons (15ml) of olive oil in the bottom of the tray. Pour in the dough, which should be light and airy by now. Using well-oiled hands, stretch the dough to cover all corners of the tray. If it doesn't stretch fully, cover it with a tea towel, let it rest for 5 minutes, and try again. Once the dough fills the tray, cover with the tea towel and let it proof for 30 minutes.\nPreheat a fan-forced oven to 220°C (428°F) or a conventional oven to 240°C (464°F).\nAfter 30 minutes, remove the tea towel.

    "instructions": "To make the marinade, mix everything except the pork in a bowl. Leave it in the fridge until you are ready to use it.\nTo prepare the pork, start by rolling it to see where the skin overlaps. Trim the skin back to that point, as you don't want any skin rolled on the inside.\nNext, remove the loin by following the seam. Then, butterfly the loin by running your knife down the middle and on each side to open it up. Add about 1/4 of the marinade and set it aside, ready to be marinated and rolled.\nTo prepare the belly part, start by scoring the skin in the opposite direction to how the string will be tied. A razor blade is ideal, but a sharp knife works too. Next, cut deep score lines into the flesh side for the marinade to penetrate.\nRub the rest of the marinade into the belly part thoroughly.\nPlace the loin back onto the belly and roll the belly over the loin. Tie the porchetta, working from the centre outwards as tightly as possible. Then, place it on an oven tray with a rack and leave it uncovered in the fridge for 24-48 hours.\nWhen ready to cook, preheat the oven to 225°C (445°F). Cook the porchetta at this temperature for 40-45 minutes, then turn the oven down to 140°C (285°F) and cook until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (170°F). This will take about 3 hours, but it's best to start checking around 1.5 hours into the cooking time.\nOnce the internal temperature reaches 75°C, remove the porchetta and let it rest for 20-30 minutes before carving and serving. If it's cooked quicker than anticipated, you can leave it to rest longer and then briefly place it back in the oven to bring the exterior back to temperature.",

Toss together with a generous pinch of Parmesan and a few torn basil leaves.\nServe immediately, topped with extra Parmesan and fresh basil.\nReserve 10% of your flour (about 60g / ½ cup) to use during mixing and rolling.\nWeigh out the remaining flour and pour it onto a clean work surface.\nUse a bowl to create a well in the centre of the flour.\nCrack the 6 eggs into the well and add a pinch of salt.\nUse a fork to break the yolks and whisk the eggs, gradually incorporating the flour from the edges of the well to avoid lumps.\nOnce the mixture thickens and becomes less liquid, use a bench scraper to cut the remaining flour into the dough.\nContinue working the dough until it forms a shaggy mass, then begin kneading by hand.\nKnead the dough for 8–10 minutes until it becomes smooth, tight, and elastic.\nShape the dough into a ball, cover it with a doubled-over tea towel or an upturned bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes.\nAfter resting, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces.\nDust your work surface with flour and roll out one piece of dough to roughly 30 x 20cm (12 x 8 inches).\nLaminate the dough by folding it lengthways into thirds, like folding a letter.\nRoll the laminated dough out again to an even thickness of about 1mm (as thin as possible).\nLightly dust the dough with flour, roll it up, and cut into tagliatelle strips 6–7 mm (¼ inch) wide.\nSeparate the strips and dust lightly with flour to prevent sticking.\nCover the cut tagliatelle with a tea towel to keep it from drying out while you repeat the process with the remaining dough.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt.\nCook the tagliatelle in small batches to avoid overcrowding, boiling for just 2–3 minutes.",

Transfer it to a clean, oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel, and let it prove for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.\nOnce the dough has risen, generously brush a full-size sheet pan with olive oil. Place the dough in the pan and gently stretch it to fill the entire surface. Cover again with a tea towel and let it prove for another hour or until doubled in size.\nWhile the dough is proving, preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F (fan-forced).\nIn a pan over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the sliced onions, 4 anchovies, and a pinch of salt. Sauté for 6-7 minutes, stirring often, until the onions are softened and lightly golden.\nAdd the peeled tomatoes to the pan, then add one-third of a tin of water to each empty can, swish, and pour into the pan.

Then add a quarter teaspoon of vanilla paste, the remaining cinnamon, the remaining sugar, and the zest of one lemon. Whip until smooth. Adjust consistency by adding lemon juice or milk as needed until it resembles thick whipped cream. Place in a piping bag and refrigerate until ready to use.\nOnce the dough has rested, remove it from the fridge and roll it out on a well-dusted bench to about 1-1.5 mm thick. Use a large cookie cutter to cut circles from the dough. Gather excess dough, if desired, to re-roll, though the quality may diminish slightly.\nRoll each pastry disc individually to form an oval shape. Wrap each around a cannoli mould (wood or metal), sealing the edge with egg whites. Ensure it is wrapped loosely to allow for expansion in the oil.\nPreheat frying oil to 180°C.

Season with a pinch of salt and cook until well-browned, ensuring even colour throughout.\nOnce the beef is browned, add the onions and cook for 1–2 minutes until softened, then add the garlic and sauté for an additional minute.\nPass the cooled potatoes through a ricer or mash thoroughly with a potato masher until smooth. Add the mashed potatoes to the beef mixture, season with additional salt, white pepper, and soy sauce, then mix well. Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to cool completely.\nDivide the cooled mixture into six even portions, rolling each into a tight ball before flattening slightly into a hockey puck shape.\nTo crumb the croquettes, first dust them in the flour, then dip in the beaten eggs, and finally coat in the panko breadcrumbs. If not frying immediately, place the croquettes on a wire rack in the fridge to prevent sogginess.\nHeat oil to 180°C / 350°F in a deep pan or fryer. Fry the croquettes for 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and hot through the centre.\nServe the croquettes simply as they are or with a side of Bulldog sauce for dipping.",

Stir in the butter until melted, then sprinkle in the flour and stir well. Gradually add the chicken stock, stirring thoroughly to prevent lumps. Simmer for 10–12 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are tender and the mixture has thickened to a fairly stiff consistency. Transfer to a tray and refrigerate until completely cool.\nOnce the dough has risen, divide it into 12 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball out to a circle roughly the size of a teacup saucer. Place 2–3 tablespoons of the cooled curry filling in the centre of each dough circle. Fold the dough over like a taco, sealing the edges by crimping tightly.\nDip each filled dough in the beaten eggs, then roll in panko breadcrumbs to coat completely.

Try your best to maintain a steady temperature of 135°C (275°F).\nAfter 4 hours, check on the ribs. You want a nicely set bark before spritzing. If some parts are getting darker than others, spritz with a 50-50 mixture of apple cider vinegar and water.\nContinue checking every 35-40 minutes, moving the ribs around if your smoker has hot spots.\nAfter around 5-6 hours, start checking the meat by probing it. The probe should slide through the meat like butter. You'll know they’re done when the probe passes through the second membrane with little resistance. The ribs should also reach a temperature of 93°C (200°F), but focus more on how they feel rather than the temperature.\nOnce the ribs are cooked, if you’re eating them immediately, let them rest at room temperature for an hour.

If you’re serving other courses, it can feed 8 people.\nPreheat the oven to 140°C (fan) or 160°C (no fan) / 275°F or 320°F.\nPlace a large Dutch oven over high heat and render some of the fat trimmings from the ribs for 5-6 minutes, then remove the excess pieces.\nSeason the ribs with salt on all sides. Place them into the hot pot and sear until you get a deep brown colour on all sides. Remove from the pot and set aside.\nAdd the carrots and onions to the pot with a small pinch of salt and brown well. Then add the garlic, celery, herbs, a few turns of black pepper, and tomato paste. Mix thoroughly.\nPour in the red wine and reduce for 6 minutes on medium heat before adding the ribs back to the pot. Cover with the beef stock.\nCover the ribs with a cartouche (a piece of parchment paper) and then the lid. Bring to a light simmer.\nOnce simmering, place the pot in the oven and cook for 4 hours, checking after 3 hours. The meat should still hold together but be jiggly and starting to fall off the bone.\nOnce cooked, remove the pot from the oven and take the ribs out. Strain the cooking liquid and begin reducing it over medium heat. Check the salt level as it reduces. Once you're happy with the seasoning, thicken the sauce by dissolving the cornflour in water, starting with half and adding more as needed.\nServe the ribs alongside mashed potatoes and green beans, with plenty of sauce.",

Place each round onto a piece of greaseproof paper. Transfer the dough circles to an airtight container and let them prove for another hour.\nGather any leftover dough scraps and re-roll them if desired, but note that these won’t be as perfect as the initial doughnuts.\nPreheat your oil to 160°C (320°F). In a bowl, mix together the 100g of sugar and the cinnamon. Also, prepare your jam by placing it in a piping bag.\nOnce the doughnuts have proved, carefully lower them into the hot oil, peeling off the greaseproof paper. Don’t overcrowd the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.\nRemove the doughnuts from the oil and drain them well. Roll them in the cinnamon sugar mixture until fully coated.\nLet the doughnuts cool for 20 minutes before cutting a small hole in the top of each. Insert the piping bag as far as possible and fill each doughnut generously with jam.\nServe warm for the best experience.",

With the blender still running, add your xanthan gum and continue to blend for 1 more minute.\nStore this in the fridge for up to 6 months, and to be honest, you will probably have finished it all well before it goes off.",

If you have a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven to heat (don’t worry if you don’t have one).\nTo make the sauce, add the tinned tomatoes to a pot and crush them with your hands. Add the oregano, 3-4 torn basil leaves, and a pinch of salt. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 25 minutes, stirring often. Once cooked, leave to cool.\nSlice the mozzarella and lay it onto a paper towel. Cover with more paper towels and place another tray on top with something to weigh it down. Leave for 20 minutes to drain excess water from the cheese.\nOnce the dough has proven, drizzle more olive oil around the outside edges and place it in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the pizza has a good colour on the top and bottom.\nRemove the pizza from the oven and leave it to cool for 15 minutes.\nNext, add the sliced mozzarella to the top of the pizza, followed by the tomato sauce.

Repeat this process three more times.\nAfter the fourth and final round of stretching and folding, let the dough rest for 30 minutes. Prepare your baking tray by lining it with baking paper and drizzling around 40ml (1.4 fl oz) of olive oil in the bottom of the tray. Pour in the dough, which should be light and airy by now. Using well-oiled hands, stretch the dough to cover all corners of the pan. If it doesn't stretch fully, cover it with a tea towel, let it rest for 5 minutes, and try again.

      "30g (1 oz) cocoa powder",
      "20g (3/4 oz) cooking salt (kosher salt)",
      "5g (1 tsp) caraway seeds",
      "750g (1 lb 10 oz) filtered water",
      "200g (7 oz) ripe sourdough starter (fed 3-5 hours before use, still rising but not yet collapsed)",
      "100g (3.5 oz) 50/50 rice flour and bread flour mix (for dusting)"
    ],
    "instructions": "In a mixing bowl, combine the dark rye flour, bread flour, cocoa powder, and caraway seeds. Mix all the dry ingredients together, then add the water and mix until the dough starts to come together.\nCover the bowl with a tea towel and let it rest for 1 hour to hydrate the flours.\nAdd the ripe starter and, using a damp hand, fold it through the dough. Once the starter is almost completely absorbed, add the salt and continue to mix for another 2-3 minutes, ensuring you can't feel any salt granules.\nScrape down the edges of the bowl to clean it, then cover with the tea towel and let rest for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, stretch and fold the dough by pinching one corner, pulling it up and folding it over itself. Repeat this three more times until you've done four stretches and folds in total.\nCover with the tea towel and let it rest for another 30 minutes. Repeat the same stretch and fold technique from the previous step. Do this two more times for a total of four rounds over two hours.\nAfter the last round, the dough should be smooth and elastic. If not, continue with one to two more rounds as needed.\nAfter the last round, cover with the tea towel and leave to bulk ferment at room temperature until the dough has grown by 40%. This can take 2-5 hours depending on your kitchen's temperature. At 24°C (75°F), it took 2.5 hours.\nOnce bulk fermentation is complete, turn the dough out onto a floured surface using the 50/50 rice flour and bread flour mix.\nCut the dough into two even pieces and preform your loaves by pulling the edges in tightly to form a loose ball. Cover with a tea towel and rest for 35-40 minutes.\nLiberally dust your oval bannetons. Shape each loaf by flattening it out first into an almost triangle shape, with the piece closest to you narrower than the piece further away. Fold the left and right sides of the dough in, then roll from the top towards yourself, pressing firmly every 3-4 cm. Crimp the seam well, then place the shaped loaf into the banneton, seam facing up.\nDust the loaves with more of the rice flour mixture, place them into an airtight bag, and refrigerate overnight to cold ferment.\nThe next day, preheat your oven or pizza oven to 280-300°C (536-572°F). Remove the dough from the fridge 20 minutes before baking. Turn out the dough onto a peel, score the top using a razor blade, dust off any excess flour, and place into the oven. Steam for the first 5 minutes of the bake, then continue baking for another 30 minutes or until fully cooked and the desired colour is achieved.\nLet the bread cool completely before slicing.

Using well-oiled hands, stretch the dough to cover all corners of the pan. If it doesn't stretch fully, cover it with a tea towel, let it rest for 5 minutes, and try again. Once the dough fills the tray, cover with the tea towel and let it proof for 30 minutes.\nPreheat a fan-forced oven to 200°C (390°F) or 220°C (430°F) for a conventional oven.\nAfter 30 minutes, remove the tea towel. Drizzle some more olive oil over the top and use your fingers to create dimples throughout the dough.

    "instructions": "Start by butterflying the chicken breasts: take a sharp knife and slice through the centre of each breast, opening it up so it's double the size. Place a piece of plastic film or parchment paper over the top and lightly pound to an even thickness throughout. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge each chicken breast in flour, dip in beaten egg, and coat with breadcrumbs. Set aside on a wire rack until ready to cook.\nIn a frying pan, heat 40ml (about 3 tablespoons) of olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced garlic with a pinch of salt. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until just softened, ensuring it doesn’t brown too much to avoid bitterness. Add the tinned tomatoes and a large piece of basil. Simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.\nAfter the sauce has been cooking for 10 minutes, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a separate large, heavy pan, heat the remaining olive oil and shallow fry the crumbed chicken for 6-7 minutes on each side until golden brown. Halfway through cooking the chicken, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions, typically 10-11 minutes.\nOnce the chicken is golden brown on both sides and almost cooked through, transfer to an oven tray. Top each breast with a spoonful of tomato sauce, slices of mozzarella, and a sprinkle of Parmesan. Grill (broil) in the oven for 6-7 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly.\nDrain the pasta, reserving some pasta water. Stir the remaining tomato sauce through the pasta, adding a few spoonfuls of pasta water to achieve the desired consistency. Serve the pasta on a plate with the cheesy, golden chicken on the side. Garnish with fresh basil.",

    "instructions": "Start by warming the milk and sugar in a small pot over low heat to about 30°C (86°F). Then, add the yeast and stir until the sugar and yeast have dissolved.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, salt, orange zest, orange juice, 2 beaten eggs, and ground cloves. Attach the dough hook and start mixing, then pour in the milk yeast mixture.\nMix the dough on low speed for 4-5 minutes or until smooth. Then, add the room temperature butter and continue to mix until the butter is fully incorporated. Turn the dough out onto the counter and roll into a tight ball. Place the ball into a container and cover with an airtight lid or cling film. Leave to prove until it has doubled in size.\nWhile the dough is proving, prepare the dye for the eggs. In two separate bowls, add 300ml water, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and a splash of each dye colour to each bowl. Mix well, then add 2 eggs to each bowl. Leave them in the colour for 20 minutes before removing and setting aside.\nOnce the dough has proved, turn it out onto a bench and cut into 3 even pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope of the same length, then plait the 3 dough ropes.\nPlace the plaited dough onto a lined tray, forming a circle and pressing the ends together to join. Place 3-4 of the coloured eggs in the centre of the plait and cover the tray with cling film. Leave to prove again for 1 hour or until it has doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 180°C (356°F).\nOnce proved, brush with beaten egg and sprinkle on the sprinkles. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it rest/cool for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.",

    "ingredients": [
      "936g (approximately 33 oz or 2.07 lbs) '00' pizza flour",
      "20g (about 0.7 oz) sea salt",
      "2g (about 0.07 oz) instant yeast",
      "654g (approximately 23 oz or 1.44 lbs) water"
    ],
    "instructions": "Begin by hydrating the yeast in a small amount (roughly 2 tablespoons) of the water measured out. Mix well and set aside for later.\nPlace the flour in a bowl and add the rest of the water. Mix until a shaggy dough forms, which will take 2-3 minutes. Cover with a tea towel and leave to rest for 1 hour.\nAfter an hour, stretch and fold the dough a couple of times (this involves taking a portion of the dough in your hand, stretching it out as far as it will go, and folding it over on itself). Next, add the hydrated yeast and use the same stretch and fold technique until the yeast is fully incorporated into the dough. Knead the dough for about 4 minutes.\nNext, add the salt and knead the dough for another 1-2 minutes or until you can't feel the grains of salt anymore.\nPlace the dough into a clear airtight container and flatten the top. Cover and use some tape to mark where the dough comes to on the container, so you can keep track of how much it rises. The dough should double in size, which will take about 6-10 hours depending on the temperature of your environment and the activity of the yeast.\nOnce it has doubled in size, turn the dough out onto a bench and stretch and fold a couple of times, then divide the dough into 270g pieces. This recipe should yield 6 portions.\nTo form the dough into balls, take each piece and fold it in on itself 3-4 times. Then, with the dough ball on the bench, pull it towards yourself using your hand. Aim for the dough ball to be nice and smooth on the top.\nPlace the dough balls into an airtight container. If you have more than one in the container, ensure you leave enough room for the dough to relax. Cover the container and place it in the fridge for at least 24 hours, though 48 hours is preferable.\nRemove the dough from the fridge 1-2 hours before you intend to make pizza, allowing them time to come to room temperature before stretching.",

    "instructions": "Start by marinating the beef strips in the soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper, and sugar. Leave in the fridge to marinate for 1-4 hours. When ready to cook, heat a large cast-iron pan or flat-top until very hot, drizzle some oil, and fry the beef quickly, being careful not to overcook.\nTo cook the carrots, simply heat some oil in a frying pan and sauté the carrots for 2-3 minutes with a little salt, finish with a little sesame oil, and leave to cool.\nTo make the omelette, beat the eggs well, then in a non-stick pan over medium heat with a little oil, add the eggs and stir. Once the eggs start to thicken, leave to set and cook through. You don't want any colour, so keep an eye on the temperature of the pan. Once the omelette is cool, simply roll up and slice into strips.\nTo cook the spinach, bring a large pot of water with a big pinch of salt to boil. Once boiling, add the spinach and cook for 1 minute before placing it into ice-cold water to stop the cooking. Drain well and squeeze all the moisture from the leaves. Dress the cooked spinach with some grated garlic and a drizzle of sesame oil.\nTo season the cooked rice, add it to a bowl with 2 tablespoons of sesame oil, 2 tablespoons of mixed and toasted sesame seeds, and a pinch of salt. Mix well and leave to cool to room temperature.\nTo assemble the Gimbap, place a sheet of seaweed paper onto a bamboo mat with the shiny side facing down. Next, spread the cooked rice across the sheet in a thin layer, leaving about a 2cm (0.8 inches) gap at the top of the sheet. Spread a small amount of each of the ingredients (spinach, carrots, beef, radish, and egg) across the centre of the rice, then roll tightly towards the top of the sheet with the gap, using a little water across the seaweed sheet to help it stick.\nRoll tightly, then rub some sesame oil on the outside to make it easier to slice. Slice the Gimbap into 8 even pieces and you're good to go!",

    "instructions": "To begin, prepare the chicken by trimming off any extra fat, reserving it for the rice. Rub the chicken in salt and leave it at room temperature whilst the poaching pot heats up.\nPlace all the chicken fat in a pot with some added peanut oil if needed, and render on low heat for 20 mins. Retain this as it will be used for both the green sauce and rice.\nIn a large pot, bring water to a light simmer and add the ginger, garlic, spring onion greens, salt, and MSG.\nAdd the chicken to the pot. Dunk the chicken 3 times to replace the water in the cavity so it heats evenly. Ensure it's fully submerged in the broth. Let it simmer for 45 minutes, flipping halfway through. Make sure the water is simmering, not boiling.\nOnce cooked, have a large bowl of ice-cold water ready. Dunk the cooked chicken into it to halt the cooking and develop the gelatinous layer under the skin. Leave for 10 minutes.\nRemove the chicken from the cold water and hang it to dry.\nGently brush the skin with sesame oil to prevent it from drying out.\nRetain the broth for the rice and sauces.\nCarve the chicken and serve with the sauces and rice.\nCombine garlic, ginger, chilli, salt, and sugar in a mortar and pestle, grinding until smooth.\nAdd the lime juice followed by the chicken stock, stirring continuously. Adjust seasoning as necessary.\nAdd the grated ginger, spring onions, salt, and sugar into a mortar and pestle. Pound until it reaches a smooth consistency, then drizzle with the hot chicken fat.\nPour chicken fat into a pot over medium heat and sauté the shallots and garlic for 4-5 minutes or until fragrant.\nRinse the rice multiple times.\nOnce the onions and garlic are prepared, combine with the washed rice in the pot, stirring well. Transfer the mixture to a rice cooker.\nTop up with chicken broth so that it's about 1 knuckle deep above the rice level. If using pandan leaves, introduce them now.\nCook as per the rice cooker's instructions.\nServe the rice alongside the carved chicken and sauces. Enjoy!",

    "instructions": "Season the rabbit pieces with salt and freshly ground pepper.\nIn a large, heavy-bottom pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the rabbit pieces, a few at a time, and brown on all sides. Remove the browned pieces and set aside.\nIn the same pot, add the shallots, carrot, and garlic. Cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.\nPour in the white wine and simmer for a few minutes until slightly reduced.\nAdd the celery, lemon peel, bay leaves, optional fennel pollen, rabbit, and chicken stock to the pot.\nPlace a baking paper cartouche (a paper lid) on top of the liquid to ensure even cooking and moisture retention. Bring to a simmer, then transfer the pot to a 160°C (320°F) oven for 1.5 hours.\nOnce the rabbit is tender, remove it from the pot and shred. Then, stir in the shredded meat and cream. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed. Finish with fresh chopped parsley.\nPreheat your oven to 180°C (355°F). Pour a generous amount of salt onto a baking sheet. Place the potatoes on the salt bed and bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until a fork can easily pierce them.\nCut the potatoes in half and scoop out the flesh, Push the scooped potato flesh through a potato ricer or mash finely with a fork. Spread the mashed potato on a clean work surface and allow it to cool for a few minutes.\nSprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the mashed potatoes. Make a well in the centre of the potatoes and pour in the beaten eggs. Sprinkle the flour over the potatoes. Starting from the centre, use your fingers to mix the ingredients until they begin to come together. Knead gently until you have a soft, slightly sticky dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.\nDivide the dough into four equal portions. Roll each portion into a long rope, about 2cm (3/4-inch) in diameter. Using a knife or a dough cutter, cut the rope into 2.5cm (1-inch) pieces.\nIn a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the gnocchi until they float to the surface, usually about 2-3 minutes. Once they float, let them cook for an additional 30 seconds. Then take them out, drain them and let them cool in the fridge until you’re ready to serve.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, add some olive oil, add the drained gnocchi to the skillet in a single layer. Allow the gnocchi to cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes or until the undersides turn golden brown. Flip the gnocchi and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.\nServe the gnocchi on top of the rabbit and garnish with some fresh parmesan.",

Place the bowl into the fridge and leave for 3-24 hours.\nDrain the milk off, rinse once again, trim the livers of any veins or tendons and dry them on a paper towel.\nMelt the butter on low heat (you just want to melt it and not make it split or bubble). Make sure you keep 50g of butter to cook the shallots.\nIn a fry pan, add 30g of the reserved butter and cook the shallots with a little salt, saute well and cook until translucent, but try to avoid much colour.\nRemove the shallots from the pan and set aside. Add the reserved butter to the pan and once it’s just starting to bubble, add the livers, season with salt and cook for 4 minutes on one side before you flip and continue to cook for 4-5 more minutes.\nAdd the cooked shallots back to the pan and then deglaze the pan with brandy and cook until the brandy has almost evaporated.\nAdd the livers and the shallots to a food processor and blend for 1 minute before slowly streaming in the warm melted butter.\nOnce all the butter is emulsified into the livers, blend for 30 seconds more before you check for seasoning one last time.\nPour the pâté into a clean jar and you can seal it with some more melted butter (optional). Leave in the fridge to set for at least 3 hours before you use it.\nAdd the carrots and daikon to a bowl and season with salt, set aside for 30 minutes.\nMix the sugar, vinegar and water until the sugar has dissolved.\nOnce the veg has set, ring out any extra liquid and place it into the pickling liquid.\nLeave this in the fridge overnight or until you are ready to use it.\nPoke lots of holes in the pork belly skin, a fork works well if you don't have the tool I have in the video.\nSeason the pork heavily on the skin side and leave uncovered in the fridge overnight.\nThe next day, brush off any extra salt and pat the skin dry. Rub some oil into the skin and give it one last season.\nPlace into a 180°C (350f) for 1.5 hours but start to check it after the first hour.\nTurn the oven to grill on 240°C and then watch it closely because it will all happen quickly at this point.

    "instructions": "Start by making the crispy onions by heating up enough oil in a saucepan over a medium high heat to shallow fry the sliced onions in batches until golden brown. Keep your eyes on them as it doesn't take long for them to crisp up.\nNext, marinate your chicken in a large pot (dutch oven) by adding the chicken, yoghurt, chilli powder, turmeric, garam masala, ginger paste, garlic, lemon juice, 1 green chilli sliced thin, 1 cinnamon stick, 8 green cardamom pods (lightly crushed), 1 tsp cumin seeds, 4 cloves, a tsp of salt, ½ of your chopped mint and ½ of the coriander, and ⅓ of the fried onions you just made.\nMix well so the spices are blended and the chicken is completely covered. Marinate for 4-24 hours in the fridge.\nStart this process about an hour before the chicken is ready to pull out of the fridge. So, if you’re marinating for four hours, start the rice at the 3 hour mark.\nWith the rice, rinse it twice then soak it in water for 40 minutes.\nAdd the warmed milk to a small bowl or jug and add in the saffron. Mix gently and set aside to steep. Optional - once your saffron milk is steeping, make the dough seal (recipe further down) and set it aside. You’ll use it later when assembling the biryani.\nBring a large pot with a lid to boil (about half full with water) and season with 1 tbsp salt, 6 green cardamom, 1 green chilli sliced lengthways in half, 1 cinnamon stick, 2 cloves and 1 tsp cumin seeds and bring to a simmer.\nDrain your soaking rice and add to the simmering water. Turn the heat on your pot to high, stir once, put the lid on and cook for 4-6 minutes or until it's just cooked. You still want a bit of bite in the rice.\nRemove the rice from the water and set aside.\nPlace the marinated chicken that’s in the pot onto a high heat and cook for 4-6 minutes, stirring every 1-2 minutes.\nTurn the heat off and remove half of the chicken with some of the sauce. This helps create two even layers when you add the rice and herbs. Spread the remaining chicken in the pot out evenly.\nThen, sprinkle half of the rice on the chicken in the pot and make sure it’s nice and even.\nAdd the remaining chicken on top of the rice and add a layer of the crispy onions and half of the remaining chopped mint and coriander.\nRepeat with the rice, crispy onions and the rest of the mint and coriander.\nDrizzle the saffron milk all over the top.\nCover the pot with the lid and seal it either with a tea towel with it sitting slightly under the lid or the dough seal (steps below).\nTurn your cooktop to medium high and cook for 10 minutes, then turn it down to very low and cook for 30 minutes.\nTake from the heat and let it rest for 20 minutes before taking the lid off and serving. If you have any remaining herbs, you can sprinkle these over the top of the rice to serve.\nIf you don’t want to do this step, you can just use a tea towel to seal the pot. If you want to make it start after you make your saffron milk.\nAdd the flour and water to a bowl and combine until it’s a shaggy mess (not too dry and not too wet) and start kneading with your hands. If it’s sticking to your board, just add some flour to help.\nRoll it out into a long batton and leave in the bowl and set aside.\nWhen you are cooking your chicken (step 14), you can prep this dough so it’s ready for the pot.\nPlace onto your bench with some flour and roll it out into a log and stretch it so it’s long enough to go around your pot.\nUse the dough to seal the pot at step 16 by wrapping it around the pot and pinching it so it fully seals it.",

Once it's warm, add the yeast to the milk/water and stir.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer with the hook attachment (or you can just use your hands), add the flour and salt, give it a mix before you add the milk/yeast mixture to it and then mix it on medium for 4-5 minutes or until you have a smooth dough.\nAt that point add the room temp butter and mix again until it's incorporated into the dough, this should take 2-3 minutes.\nTake the dough from the bowl and make it into a tight ball, then place it into a bowl (I just use the mixer bowl), cover it and let it double in size, this will take 1-1.5 hours.\nOnce it doubles in size, give it a quick knead and then cut it into 9 even pieces. Roll them tightly into balls and then grease a 22cm springform cake tin.\nPlace the balls into the cake tin evenly, then cover the tin and leave it to prove for another hour or the dough balls have doubled.\nWhile they are proving, preheat your oven to 180c (355f).\nOnce the dough has proved, brush it with some milk and sprinkle some salt flakes on the top. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden and cooked through.\nJust before they come out of the oven, add the butter and garlic to a pot and cook on low for 4-5 minutes to take some of the sharpness of the garlic, note you don't want to fry the garlic (make sure it has no colour) then at the end add some finely sliced parsley.\nAs soon as the bread comes from the oven, pour over the garlic butter and let it cool for 10 minutes before removing it from the tin.\nEnjoy while it's still warm!",

Timer on for 6 minutes. Once they’re done, run under some cold water so they stop cooking.\nCheck the bacon and if the fat has rendered, flip it over to cook the other side. Flip again, just to get some extra colour on both sides. Remove from the pan onto a plate with a paper towel.\nCheck your chicken and if it’s golden on the skin side, turn over. Check the temperature. Now, you can finish your chicken in the oven or in the pan depending on where the temperature is at.

    "instructions": "Start by washing your rice 3 times and then cooking it in a rice cooker with 1.5 parts water to 1 part rice.\nTo prep the beef, start by taking all the silver skin and fat off and then slicing it into 0.5 x 3 cm strips.\nMarinate the beef in 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp soy sauce, and 0.5 tbsp sesame oil. You will do the same whether you're going to serve the beef raw or cooked.\nTo make the finishing sauce, grab a bowl and mix together 2 heaped tsp of Gochujang, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil, and 1 tsp honey.\nNext, cook all your vegetables individually in a large frypan or wok with sesame oil, and season with soy sauce and a little bit of garlic for each one.\nFor the baby spinach, sauté in oil and finish with some of the toasted sesame seeds.\nThis is the point where you need to decide whether you're going to cook your beef or serve raw in a hot clay pot. If you are going to cook it, simply heat some oil up on your wok and sauté for 1-2 minutes or until just cooked.\nTime to assemble, start by placing your rice in the bottom of your bowl or hot clay pot, then simply assemble all the veggies around the outside. Place the beef in the centre and if you have chosen the raw beef, finish it with the egg yolk. If you have decided to cook the beef, then fry an egg for the top.\nLastly, put on as much or as little of the Gochujang sauce and enjoy!",

    "instructions": "Start by cutting your trout fillets down the centre and flipping the end of one piece to the opposite end of the other piece, making an even thickness all the way through.\nSeason it lightly with salt and then using clingfilm, wrap tightly into a cylinder vac pack and cook in a water circulator at 50°C for 30 minutes.\nOnce cooked, remove and place into ice-cold water.\nFor the mushroom duxelles, sauté the onions and 1 tbsp of olive oil. Once they are translucent, add the diced mushrooms and season with salt and pepper and cook for 6-7 minutes.\nDeglaze the pan with the brandy and continue to cook until you have a nice dry consistency. This should take roughly 10-12 minutes.\nStrip your kale from the storks, trying to keep it in large pieces, then in salted boiling water, blanch for 2 minutes. Then, place into ice cold water to stop the cooking and, using a clean tea towel, dry the kale very well.\nTo assemble the Wellington, start with a layer of the crêpes, followed by an even spread of the mushroom duxelles and then a layer of the blanched kale.\nRemove the trout from the plastic wrap and lightly brush it all over with the mustard. Place this on top of the kale and tightly wrap the crêpe, kale and mushrooms evenly around the trout.\nWrap this tightly in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nLay down one piece of puff pastry, then remove the trout from the clingfilm and place on top of the pastry, add another layer of pastry, making sure you seal the edges well using the egg.\nOptionally, place another layer of puff pastry as a decorative piece, then brush the whole Wellington with egg wash and sprinkle with sea salt.\nIn a 180°c fan forced oven, bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.",
